# TCW3 â€” Cross-platform GUI toolkit

<!-- This file is imported as the top-level doc comment of `tcw3` -->

## Architectural Overview

**[`tcw3::pal`]** abstracts the underlying window system and
graphics libraries. It defines the concept of main thread and a trait
[`Wm`] for compile-time thread checking. `Wm` also provides several entry
point functions for the clients to call. Several backends are provided.
During a build, one of them is chosen based on the target platform and given
feature flags, and its public types such as [`Wm` (type)] and [`HWnd`] are
reexported at the crate root. The clients are supposed to use these
reexported items.

[`tcw3::pal`]: tcw3_pal
[`Wm`]: tcw3_pal::iface::Wm
[`Wm` (type)]: tcw3_pal::Wm
[`HWnd`]: tcw3_pal::HWnd

The API surface of `tcw3::pal` is carefully designed so that all backends
can implement the same interface, while ensuring the features of each target
platform are well utilized, the abstraction overhead is reasonably low, and
the engineering cost is acceptable.
For example, details of widget handling are vastly different between
platforms, so `tcw3::pal` has no concept of widgets, and widgets are instead
realized by `tcw3::uicore`. On the other hand, with regard to text input
handling, text input widgets are modeled as an abstract text storage and
the widgets don't have to deal with key strokes entered by the user.

`tcw3::pal` has a headless backend named `testing`, which is used for
testing various components built based on `tcw3::pal`. `testing` has a
dedicated interface to programmatically control the simulated window system,
which is exposed at [`tcw3::pal::testing`].

**[`tcw3::images`]** provides a type **[`HImg`]**, which represents a
scale-independent image that is rasterized on-demand. `tcw3::ui::theming`
uses this extensively to render non-rectangular shapes in widgets.
`tcw3::images` also manages the list of DPI scaling factors currently in use
by the user's desktop. The cache of rasterized bitmaps are categorized by
DPI scaling factors, and bitmaps are automatically released when the
associated DPI scaling factor is no longer in use. To implement this cache
management policy, a signaling mechanism that notifies changes in the global
list of DPI scaling factors is needed, but `tcw3::pal` doesn't provide
a facility for that.
It's `tcw3::uicore` that tells `tcw3::images` which DPI scaling factor is in
use and which one is no longer used. Other clients may do the same, but this
is usually unnecessary.

**[`tcw3::uicore`]** is a widget toolkit built on top of the aforementioned
subsystems. It introduces the concept of *views*, which are nestable
rectangular regions inside a window that can receive user inputs and display
graphical contents. It provides a framework for laying out views using
*layout* objects. It's responsible for routing input events received by
windows to appropriate views.

[`tcw3::uicore`]: crate::uicore

`uicore` is by no means meant to be a complete widget toolkit by itself. The
appearance of views is not defined at all by `uicore`. Also, `uicore`
doesn't completely abstract `pal`, so widgets and applications occasionally
have to use `pal` directly.

**[`tcw3::ui`]** is an assortment of libraries built on top of `uicore`.
**[`tcw3::ui::theming`]** is a styling framework that allows decoupling
between logic and style. `theming` provides a view [`StyledBox`], which is
often used to define the appearance of widgets.
**[`tcw3::ui::mixins`]** provides *mix-ins*, which handle input events
(through composition) to implement common GUI behaviors.
Other submodules provide useful premade views and layouts.

[`tcw3::ui`]: crate::ui
[`tcw3::ui::theming`]: crate::ui::theming
[`tcw3::ui::mixins`]: crate::ui::mixins
[`StyledBox`]: crate::ui::theming::StyledBox

**`tcw3_designer`** (Designer) is a declarative framework for writing
GUI components with less boilerplate code. It's meant to be invoked by a
build script (`build.rs`). The generate code requires a runtime library
located in [`tcw3::designer_runtime`].
`designer` stores the definition of components in *meta crates*. Build
scripts invoking `designer` should import the definition of components they
use from meta crates. For the widgets defined by `tcw3::ui`, the
meta crate is [`tcw3_meta`].

### Headless Backend

The **`testing`** feature enables the `testing` backend of `tcw3::pal`,
which is a headless backend that simulates the behavior of a real window
system. This is mainly used for unit testing and is supposed to be enabled
only when running tests by passing a command-line option like
`cargo test --workspace --all-features`. When the feature is not enabled,
the entry point function explained in the next paragraph will do nothing
except for outputting a warning message.

Enabling the feature alone doesn't activate the headless backend. You need
to call a specific entry point function and pass a closure. The closure
will receive `&dyn TestingWm` that can be used to send simulated input
events to the backend.
See the documentation of [`tcw3::pal::testing`] for more details.

*Note: You need to enable the `testing` feature to see the documentation.*

**[`tcw3::testing`]** provides an attribute macro useful for writing unit
tests using the `testing` backend.

### Color Management

Color values are specified in the sRGB color space, unless otherwise
specified.

*Full color management support is yet to be implemented. Some backends
are incapable of doing even a basic color management at the moment.*
