//! Implements the table view, a scrollable widget that displays subviews in
//! imaginary table cells.
//!
//! # General Properties
//!
//! - The table view supports displaying > 1,000,000,000 lines (rows and
//!   columns).
//! - Lines can be dynamically inserted and/or removed. The time complexity of
//!   inserting/removing a single consecutive range of lines which are not in
//!   view is logarithmic in ordinary cases. (However, it's linear on regard to
//!   the number of visible lines.)
//! - Reordering is not natively supported; it must be implemented as removal
//!   followed by insertion at the new location.
//! - Lines have a homogeneous, dynamic size (width or height). To make this
//!   practical, the sizes of off-screen lines may use approximation. Their
//!   sizes are not affected in any way by subviews' size traits.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! - Line coordinates and line indices are represented using `i64`. Once the
//!   calculation result or intermediate results get past the representable
//!   range of `i64`, weird things might occur.
//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! - A *line* refers to a column or a row in a table. When manipulating lines,
//!   [`LineTy`] specifies which of them is being updated. For example,
//!   `(LineTy::Row, 0)` represents the first row.
//! - The *line size* of a line is a width or height of the line.
//!
//! [`LineTy`]: table::LineTy
//!
//! ## Table model
//!
//! A table model is a conceptual entity representing the content of a table
//! view. It's comprised of two sequences of line sizes each for columns and
//! rows and subviews representing table cells, which are realized on-demand.
//!
//! Objects representing a table model are predominantly owned by `Table`.
//!
//!  - `Table` tracks the number of lines in the table model.
//!  - `Table` owns a [`TableModelQuery`] object supplied by the application.
//!     - `Table` gets line sizes or a sum of line sizes by calling a method of
//!        [`TableModelQuery`].
//!     - `Table` maintains a `HView` and [`CellCtrler`] for every cell in the
//!        view. They are created by calling a method of `TableModelQuery`.
//!
//! To start making changes to the table model, the application locks the table
//! model state by calling [`Table::edit`] and obtains a lock guard of type
//! [`TableEdit`]. The application makes changes by calling `TableEdit`'s
//! methods. Some editing operations require the application to follow a
//! particular sequence. For example, when inserting lines, the application must
//! first update `TableModelQuery` so that when `TableEdit::insert` looks at
//! it, all new lines are already inserted at the intended position.
//!
//! `TableEdit` provides a mutable reference to the current `TableModelQuery`
//! object. It's the only reasonable way to access the `TableModelQuery` object
//! owned by `Table` because mutating it in other ways is likely to
//! desynchronize the objects involved in shaping the table model.
//!
//! Editing operations supported by `TableEdit` are exposed through the trait
//! [`TableModelEdit`]. This allows the application to insert a model layer to
//! implement a functionality such as animation by designing the update code to
//! operate on generic `TableModelEdit` types, not just `TableEdit`.
//!
//! [`Table::edit`]: table::Table::edit
//! [`CellCtrler`]: table::CellCtrler
//! [`TableModelQuery`]: table::TableModelQuery
//! [`TableModelEdit`]: table::TableModelEdit
//! [`TableEdit`]: table::TableEdit
